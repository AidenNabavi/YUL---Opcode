# YUL-Opcode


Welcome to **Yul Playground** — a collection of Yul smart contract examples, snippets, and experiments for low-level EVM hacking and optimization.  

## 📌 What is Yul?

**Yul** is an intermediate, low-level programming language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (**EVM**). It’s designed as a common denominator for various backends (EVM 1.0, eWASM). Yul offers developers fine-grained control over how contracts are compiled and executed, making it perfect for:

- Writing highly optimized smart contracts  
- Auditing EVM-level bytecode  
- Understanding how Solidity compiles down to low-level operations  
- Experimenting with advanced gas optimizations  

Yul is unopinionated: no high-level syntax sugar, no inheritance, no modifiers — just you and the raw EVM.

## 📂 Repo Structure

This repository includes:
- `examples/` — Common Yul patterns and minimal contracts.
- `snippets/` — Useful code pieces for memory, storage, call handling, etc.
- `experiments/` — Fun or risky experiments to push EVM boundaries.
- `build/` — Compiled output (optional).

## ⚙️ Requirements

To work with Yul, you’ll need:
- [Solidity Compiler (`solc`)](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html)
- A local dev environment (Node.js, Hardhat, or Foundry can help integrate testing)
- Basic understanding of EVM opcodes
